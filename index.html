    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>A group of friends wander into an abandoned retail store nearby.</p>
    <p>The group of girls quickly ran inside for shelter. But suddenly they heard...</p>
    <p>An intercom message with a mysterious, deep voice saying "All Walmart prisoners, please be on standby for incoming indoctrination."</p>
    <p>Afraid of what might be coming next, the girls ran for the door. **doors slam shut** They franticlly looked for another exit, only to find there was only one way in or out.</p>
    <p>A trap door from the floor opens and an former employee of the Walmart store calls out to the girls "Follow me! I know another way out!"</p>
